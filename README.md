# Overview
## What is SGP?
The Software Genome Project (SGP) treats software as assemblies of “genes,” making it easier to trace dependencies, validate code quality, and manage licensing. Our ecosystem combines:
- Open-source governance via specialized repoDAO.
- Economic incentives using Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) and Proof-of-Merit (PoM).
- Secure, transparent licensing through dual-tier licensing models and NFT-driven solutions.

## Repo Structure
This repo hosts:
- High-level category information for our four DAO types (Established, Digital Trust, Digital Academy, Incubation).
- Individual DAO details, each stored in its own folder under docs/dao/.
- Community guidelines and contribution instructions.
- The complete SGP White Paper, references, and figures.
